# Future Features
We will soon implement Memberships, Attendance, Venues full CRUDS and Update CRUD for our Events component

# Technical Details
A few of the greatest challenges faced during this project composition includes conditional loading, proper utilization and construction of state, and breaking down each step within project construction.  I would frequently find I had tangentially moved to another component or task while coding this project

Another challenge and accomplished feat involved solving how to best format our Date and Time information to meet the requirements within each component.  These were the helper functions composed to complete this task:

```
 //date and time helper functions
    function splitDateTime(dateTimeString) {
        const [date, fullTime] = dateTimeString.split('T');
        const time = fullTime ? fullTime.split('.')[0] : '';
        return { date, time } ;
    }
    
    function splitEndTime(dateTimeString) {
        const [endDate, fullTime] = dateTimeString.split('T');
        const endTime = fullTime ? fullTime.split('.')[0] : '';
        return { endDate, endTime } ;
    }

    function convertToAMPM(timeString) {
        if (!timeString) return '';
        const [hour, minute] = timeString.split(':');
        let amOrPm = 'AM';
        let adjustedHour = parseInt(hour, 10);
    
        if (adjustedHour >= 12) {
            amOrPm = 'PM';
            if (adjustedHour > 12) {
                adjustedHour -= 12;
            }
        }
        
        return `${adjustedHour}:${minute} ${amOrPm}`;
    }
```

A section of code I wish to revise in the future for efficiency includes my Group Detail component which also hosts all upcoming events and past events.  Rewriting my store to hold this information in state without having to make multiple calls to the backend would drastically increase the functioning speed of my application:

```

{showModal && (
            <Modal onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}>
                {modalContent === 'joinGroup' && (
                    <div className='feature-coming-soon'>
                        <div>Feature coming soon...</div>
                    </div>
                )}

                {modalContent === 'deleteConfirmation' && (
                    <div className="confirm-modal-content">
                        <div className="confirm-modal-title">
                            Confirm Delete
                        </div>
                        <div className="confirm-modal-text">
                            Are you sure you want to delete this group?
                        </div>
                        <div className="confirm-modal-option-1">

                        <div className="confirm-modal-option-2">
                            <button className='single-card-crud-event' onClick={() => setShowModal(false)}>Cancel (Keep Group)</button>
                        </div>

                    </div>
